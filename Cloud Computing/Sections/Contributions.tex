\section{Planned Contributions}
After considering the different issues presented in the project and coordinating with the rest of my team, my plan is to contribute to the project by performing implementation of the two following issues:\\\\
\href{https://gitlab.sdu.dk/jolee18/cloud-bite-terraform-g-10/-/issues/10}{Issue 10: Use Secret Manager to store database sensitive information.}\\\\
Implementation of this issue will be performed by making use of the Google Secret Manager to store sensitive data, making it inaccessible to potential bad actors.
\\
\\
\href{https://gitlab.sdu.dk/jolee18/cloud-bite-terraform-g-10/-/issues/6}{Issue 6: Create build pipeline for frontend and backend applications.}
\\\\
Implementation of this issue will be performed by defining the build pipeline dependencies, dependents, build locations and deployment targets in the yaml format.
\\\\
Additionally, I am planning to help out with any additional work that arises with implementation of the other issues in the project, and helping to continually document the work performed.
