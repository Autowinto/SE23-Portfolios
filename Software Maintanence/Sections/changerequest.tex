\section{Change Request}
From the list of features that were available to be implemented, in the group, it was decided, that I would be implementing the "open various formats" feature. This includes png, jpg, gif, pct and text. 

\subsection{User Story}
The change request, defined as a user story, is as follows:

\textbf{"As a user, I want to be able to open images of the formats png, jpg, gif, pct, and text, so that I can work with many different formats without having to convert myself"}

\subsection{Acceptance Criteria}
The following subtasks as identified serve as acceptance criteria:
\textbf{%
\begin{itemize}
    \item When I click on the 'Open' option, the software should allow me to browse and select files in png, jpg, gif, pct, and text formats.
    \item Upon selecting a valid file of the mentioned formats, the software should display the image or content correctly within the workspace.
    \item If I attempt to open a corrupted or unsupported file type, the software should provide a clear error message.
    \item The software should maintain the original quality of the image when opening it.
    \item For text files, the software should provide an option to convert the text into an editable shape or object in the drawing workspace.
\end{itemize}
