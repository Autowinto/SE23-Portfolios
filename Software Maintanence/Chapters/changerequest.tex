\section{Change Request}
For this project in the Software Maintanence course, I decided to refactor the feature that allows the user to open and load various files into the software. The feature itself had several subfeatures, namely subfeatures for jpg, png, svg, text etc., but for this exact report, I decided to focus specifically on PNG files.

\subsection{User Story}
The change request, defined as a user story, is as follows:
\\\\
"As a user, I want to be able to open image files on my computer, so that I can edit them."

\subsection{Acceptance Criteria}
The following subtasks as identified serve as acceptance criteria:


\begin{itemize}
    \item When I click on the 'Open' option, the software should allow me to browse and select files in png, jpg, gif, pct, and text formats.
    \item Upon selecting a valid file of the mentioned formats, the software should display the image or content correctly within the workspace.
    \item If I attempt to open a corrupted or unsupported file type, the software should provide a clear error message.
    \item The software should maintain the original quality of the image when opening it.
    \item For text files, the software should provide an option to convert the text into an editable shape or object in the drawing workspace.
\end{itemize}
