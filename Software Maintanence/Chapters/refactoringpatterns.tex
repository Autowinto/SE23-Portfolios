\section{Refactoring Patterns and Code smells}

There is so much fucking duplicated code.
The methods are incredibly long
Method names are fucked and have no proper meaning
Long parameter lists
Confusing naming of classes and functions.

There is no reason to be abbreviating variables to the point of them being single letters. It makes for confusing code, especially in longer methods.

Describe the code smell that triggered your refactoring, see Chapter 4 in [Ker05].
Describe what you plan to change by refactoring.
Why do you think it's good to do the refactoring?
Describe the strategy of the refactorings. Remember there is not one way to implement a pattern.
Which of the refactorings from [Ker05] did you apply and what was the reasoning behind it?
