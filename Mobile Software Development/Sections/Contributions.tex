\section*{Contributions}
My contributions to the project lie mainly in the implementation of the application, as well as creation of part of the StyleSheets used to ensure that the design and the actual application were design-wise aligned.
\\\\
In terms of stylesheets, another group member created many of the base styles and concepts that we used to translate our figma model into an actual application, I did however to a lot of custom styling on the Car List screen as well as some on the Login page to ensure consistency in the design.
\\\\
The implementation of the actual functionality is where my most of my contributions lie. I performed a lot of the research when it came to figuring out dependency issues, bugs in our code, how to translate designs to functional components, how to implement navigation and more. The entire CarList page, navigation between the pages, fetching data from a backend, placing said data inside an AsyncStore, manipulating said data once it was in the store and keeping track of what cars are available and ensuring that the reactive state of the application is in sync are all things performed mostly by me.
