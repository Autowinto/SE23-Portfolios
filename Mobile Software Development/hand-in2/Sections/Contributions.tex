\section{Contributions}
My contributions towards the Android project lie in the design and application of the frontend as well as backend parts of the application. Moreso in the frontend where I took a project lead role more than the backend where I had more of a consulting role. We decided that I would be working on the frontend, as I have a lot of experience creating NodeJS backends as part of my day job, and it would make more sense to allow other team members to practive their skills in that regard. This did however, end up creating several issues, such as an unstable backend prone to crashes and REST principles not being adhered to, however the backend exists and is functional.

I created all of the Retrofit data class definitions, the Api interfaces, researched the usage of coroutines and implemented these in the application as well as fixed several backend issues and crashes as they arose when attempting to use the frontend HTTP request client. I also setup the frontend project in its entirety creating all of the Activity pages and ui components, leaving the implementation of about half of them to two other frontend team members.

The teamwork between the backend and frontend team left something to be desired. Lacking api documentation and communication made working with the API hard. Especially when breaking changes were suddenly introduced without communication, prompting us to have to seek out the issue in the backend code.
