Description:
  This module exploits a Remote Command Execution vulnerability in the
  Drupal CODER Module. Unauthenticated users can execute arbitrary
  commands under the context of the web server user.

  The CODER module doesn't sufficiently validate user inputs in a script
  file that has the PHP extension. A malicious unauthenticated user can
  make requests directly to this file to execute arbitrary commands.
  The module does not need to be enabled for this to be exploited.

  This module was tested against CODER 2.5 with Drupal 7.5 installed on
  Ubuntu Server.
