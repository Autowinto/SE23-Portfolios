\subsection{Discuss your Data Flow Diagram \& STRIDE}
\emph{%
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Create a data flow diagram\\
    Please do not worry too much about the exact way the data flow diagram is created,
    you can find a lot of information online which is adding more detail than we need.
    Focus on where the data travels and use the literature provided as inspiration.
  \item Formulate STRIDE\\
    For each of the categories, describe at least $2$ threats based on your data flow diagram,
    putting them down in a list or table.
  \end{itemize}
}
