\section{Exercise 09: Intrusion Detection}
Being able to detect intruders in a given system is vital to maintaining a secure system.
\subsection{Use case of the presented options}
There are several different tools tested and provided through the exercise with different use cases and scenarios, which can all work together to create a more secure system by detecting intrusions.
\subsubsection{Logcheck}
Logchecking is an important part of a secure system, for several reasons. The sheer amount of information which is constantly being logged by even a medium-sized server or application is impossible to manually monitor and sift through. Therefore automated solutions such as using logcheck in conjunction with postfix to notify a responsible administrator of detections is a necessary thing to have implemented for proper security. It also gives us detailed information about the incident, so that we, as an advanced user can either fix the issue or use the provided information to improve the security of our system.
