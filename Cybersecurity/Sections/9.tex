\section{Exercise 09: Intrusion Detection}
Being able to detect intruders in a given system is vital to maintaining a secure system.
\subsection{Use case of the presented options}
There are several different tools tested and provided through the exercise with different use cases and scenarios, which can all work together to create a more secure system by detecting intrusions.
\subsubsection{Logcheck}
Logchecking is an important part of a secure system, for several reasons. The sheer amount of information which is constantly being logged by even a medium-sized server or application is impossible to manually monitor and sift through. Therefore automated solutions such as using logcheck in conjunction with postfix to notify a responsible administrator of detections is a necessary thing to have implemented for proper security.
